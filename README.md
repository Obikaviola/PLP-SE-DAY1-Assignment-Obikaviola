## Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

### Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software. It is concerned with a disciplined and systematic approach to building programs that solves problems. 

**Importance Of Software Engineering**
1. It is concerned with solving complex problems.
2. Software engineering increases efficiency by building highly efficient programs.
3. It creates high demand job opportunities.
4. It allows the addition of features therefore allowing flexibility.
5. It provides room for scalability in cases where there might be increased numbers of users.
6. It is helps in reducing complexity.

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
1. The birth of software engineering as a discipline: In 1968, at the NATO conference, the term software engineering was first used. This led to the conception of software engineering best practices like methodologies, requirements analysis, software testing etc.
2. Internet and web development: The introduction of the world wide web led to the focus on web development which led to development of web development technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS etc.
3. Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and Automation: AI, ML and automation which is still an evolving trend has led and is still leading to great improvement in the software engineering space.

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
1. Planning: the scope of the project and objectives are defined. Here risks, estimated costs and required resources are identified. 
2. Requirements Analysis: Here stakeholders are involved and requirements are gathered and documented. 
3. Design: The software structure, database and user interface is designed. Here security measures, system components and data flow is specified. 
4. Implementation: The actual code are written by developers using programming languages, frameworks and tools. 
5. Testing: The software is checked to ensure it meets the requirements and functions properly by identifying and fixing bugs through u    nit, integration, system and user acceptable testing. 
6. Deployment: The software is released either in phases or in full deployment.
7. Maintenance and support: The software performance is improved, bugs are fixed and updates are provided.

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
Waterfall methodology | Agile Methology
--------------------- | ------------------
It is done in sequential and linear spaghetti approach | It is done in an Iterative and incremental approach
Rigid as changes are difficult to implement | Highly flexible and allows the adaptation to changes quickly
Defined phases | Phases are done in iteratations with continuous feedback and improvement
Clients involvement are limited to the beginning and end of the project | Clients are involved throughout the process 
Documentation is extensively done | Documentation is minimal as focus is on working software. 
Long delivery cycle as software is delivered at the end of the cycle | Short delivery cycle as working software is delivered frequently

Waterfall is best suited for projects that are well defined, regulatory and heavily complianced like medical software while agile methodology is best suited for fast paced, evolving requirements and continuous integration and improvement project like game development.

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**

*Software developer writes, tests and maintain software code using version control systems based on requirements. They also collaborate with designers, testers and other developers.

*A quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring software meets quality standards before release. They design test plans, test cases and automated test scripts. They conduct manual and automated testing where they identify, report and track bugs.

*A project manager oversees the software development process, ensuring project goals are met on time and within budget. They also manage resources, team coordination and risk mitigation. They communicate with stakeholders, clients and the development team in ensuring that the project is done within a time frame.

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**

*Integrated development environment (IDE) is an application software that provides a comprehensive environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. An example of IDE is Visual studio code.

*Version control system (VCS) is a tool that tracks changes in code, enabling collaboration and version management. An example of VCS is Git.

**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
*Software engineers have issues maintaining, debugging and understanding complex codebases. They can overcome this by following clean code principles and using version control systems.

*They have issues meeting deadlines and project timelines. To overcome this, they need to set realistic deadlines, use agile methodology and communicate regularly with stakeholders. 

*Another issue is debugging and fixing bugs. They can overcome this by using debugging tools and writing unit and integration tests. 

*Software engineers are faced with security vulnerabilities by hackers. They can overcome this by following secure coding practices, regularly update dependencies, use security tools and conducting security audits.

**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**
* Unit testing: It involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation. It catches bugs early, making it easier and cheaper to fix them.

*Integration testing: It tests how different components or modules interact with each other. It detects issues in data flow and interaction between different modules before deployment. 

*System testing: It tests the entire application as a complete system to ensure it meets requirements. It validates the software's overall performance, functionality and compliance with business requirements.

*Acceptance testing: It ensures the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment. It determines whether the software is fit for release and acceptable to the client.

### Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
**Prompt engineering** involves structuring queries in a way that guides the AI to generate the most relevant, accurate and useful responses.

**Importance of Prompt Engineering**
1. It leads to clearer, more detailed and contextually accurate responses. 
2. It prevents AI from generating irrelevant or vague answers.
3. It helps in preparing AI for specific tasks. 
4. It maximizes AI creativity and problem solving.

**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
An example of a vague prompt is write a letter of absenteeism.

Improved version - Write a semi-formal letter of absenteeism to my boss Mrs. Mary. Highlighting the reason for my absence as being ill.
